Microsoft Office Telemetry: Tracking Your Every Move
======

Thanks to everyone for the great feedback from my presentation at OSDFCon! I've had a few requests for copies of the slides, and after taking a second look, I realized the slides are quite unhelpful without my yammering narration. Hopefully this post will provide both the slides and the context.

The Scenario
------

We've been provided three forensic images, each from a user's workstation at Reynholm Industries. The company wants to know which user modified an Excel spreadsheet stored on a Windows network share. We are only provided images of the workstations' hard drives (no memory images). Examination of these drives provides only inconclusive results. We are unable to obtain any information from the network share.
